 <h1>HTML Technical DOCUMENTATION</h1> 
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>HTML is an acronym for HyperText Markup Language, and is the standard language for creting web-pages. Every web page you surf on your browser is built using HTML. The primary use of HTML is to provide a proper structure to the web page so all the content or data of the page could represent adequately. A stand-alone HTML can create only static and skeleton looking black and white pages, but with the help of CSS and Javascript,we can create a more interactive and intuitive web page. When we try to visit a website or click on the link, we basically request the server to show us the page, then the server acts on our request and sends us the appropriate HTML document as a response. Then this HTML document parsed by browse, and we are able to see the content.</p>
  <h3>HTML Editors</h3>
  <p>However, you can use notepad to create and edit HTML documents,but we recommend to install an open-source editor. There are many free to use text-editor software present on the internet, which provides a better interactive User interface and some add-on functionality which you miss on a notepad.</p>
  <p>Here is the list of top 4 HTML text editors</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Atom</li>
            </ul>
<b>HTML Elements</b>
<p>The HTML elements provide the semantic meaning to the web-page content. We usually interchangeably use the term HTML elements and tags, but technically both are different. An HTML tag is just a character inside the angled brackets. Whereas the HTML element is a collection of starting tag, its attribute, content and end tag. <b>example</b> <code>&lt;p class= "para"&gt; Hello wWorld /p></code></p>
<b>HTML Attributes</b>
<p>In HTML, the attributes are used to provide additional information about the elements. For most of the HTML elements, attributes are optional, but there are some elements where we have to deliver the attributes. Attributes always specified within the opening tag of the HTML element and they are specified in a name or value pair. <b>example</b> <code>&lt;image src="cat.jpg" alt ="cat image"&gt;</code></p>
<h6>HTML Heading</h6>
<p>To display the section heading, title or subtitle we can use the HTML heading tags. In HTML we have 6 heading tags</p>
<b>HTML Paragraph</b>
<p>In HTML, paragraphs can be defined using the p element. Paragraph text always starts from a new line.</p>
<b>HTML Style</b>
<p>Every browser has a specific engine that parses the HTML document and displays a default style of the page content.</p>
<b>HTML Formatting</b>
<p>In HTML, we hav many special elements that can provide special meaning to text content.</p>
